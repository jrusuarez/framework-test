# Instructions

## Problem description

Frameworks provide an easy way to bootstrap any kind of application. In the case of Node.js, express is the most popular framework for writing servers.

In this exercise we provide a very simple example of an API written with express. This example is poorly designed and it contains bad practices and mistakes. Your task will be to spot those mistakes or bad practices and refactor the code to be follow good design patterns and to be cleaner and more scalable.

In order to solve the problem you can use any open source third-party libraries from the npm registry.

Once the problem is solved, please open a pull request with your solution.
